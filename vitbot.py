#We need to import two classes for this purpose: ChatBot from chatterbot and ListTrainer from chatterbot.trainers:
from chatterbot import ChatBot
from chatterbot.trainers import ListTrainer

#Our bot will be an instance of the class ChatBot:
#You can provide read_only=True if you want to disable the botâ€™s ability to learn after the training (i.e. from actual conversations).
#logic_adapters is the list of adapters used to train the bot.
my_bot = ChatBot(name='PyBot', read_only=True,

#We can create and train the bot by creating an instance of ListTrainer and supplying it with the lists of strings:
list_trainer = ListTrainer(my_bot)
for item in (small_talk, math_talk_1, math_talk_2):
    list_trainer.train(item)

#You have to use get_response method to input things. Things inside the method are customizable.
